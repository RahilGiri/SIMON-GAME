Overview

This is a classic Simon Game developed as part of a JavaScript-based web development challenge. The game is an interactive memory game where players need to repeat the sequence of colors and sounds displayed by the game. The sequence increases in complexity with each correct repetition, testing the player’s memory and focus.

Features
	•	Color and Sound Sequences: The game generates a random sequence of color flashes and corresponding sounds.
	•	Player Interaction: Players must repeat the sequence by clicking the correct color buttons in the same order.
	•	Increasing Difficulty: Each time the player repeats the sequence correctly, the sequence gets longer, making the game progressively harder.
	•	Game Over Condition: The game ends if the player clicks the wrong button or fails to repeat the sequence correctly.

Tech Stack
	•	HTML: For structuring the game interface.
	•	CSS: To style the game interface and provide visual feedback (e.g., button highlighting).
	•	JavaScript: To implement game logic, event handling, and sequence generation.
	•	Audio Downloaded: For playing sounds corresponding to each color button.

Game Rules
	1.	The game will start with a sequence of 1 color. The player needs to click the button that matches the color.
	2.	After each correct click, a new color is added to the sequence, and the player must repeat the entire sequence.
	3.	The player must click the correct buttons in the same order to continue progressing.
	4.	The game ends if the player clicks the wrong button, at which point their current score is displayed.
